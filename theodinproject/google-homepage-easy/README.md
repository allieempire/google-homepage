I've spent a week with OP, and a couple months (more off than on) with Treehouse and Pluralsight. Something still has not clicked with positioning, but at least I learned how to use a box shadow!

I had the most trouble with positioning and styling the search bar and buttons. I'd had no experience with buttons, but am now much more comfortable. My issue with the search bar involved a border. Couldn't think of anything else and jokingly tried adding a small border. Fixed my problem. Felt like an idiot. Face met palm.

Positioning is still difficult for me. I understand how fixed, absolute and relative are different and what their functions are, but I have a hard time remembering how to use them appropriately in practice.

I'll get better.
